# This file provides exceptions to the usual rules applied to ELF objects by
# check_rtime. All strings are Perl regular expressions that are compared to
# file paths. In addition to the standard Perl syntax, there is one extension:
#
#	MACH(dir)
#
# is expanded into a regular expression that matches the given
# directory, or a 64-bit subdirectory of the directory with the
# name of a 64-bit architecture. For example, MACH(lib) will match
# any of the following:
#
#	lib
#	lib/amd64
#	lib/sparcv9
#
#
# Files for which we skip checking of duplicate addresses in the
# symbol sort sections. Such exceptions should be rare --- most code will
# not have duplicate addresses, since it takes assember or a "#pragma weak"
# to do such aliasing in C. C++ is different: The compiler generates aliases
# for implementation reasons, and the mangled names used to encode argument
# and return value types are difficult to handle well in mapfiles.
