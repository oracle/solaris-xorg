 Author:  Marc Aurele La France (TSI @ UQV), tsi@xfree86.org

 This is the ATI driver for XFree86.

 John Donne once said "No man is an island", and I am most certainly not an
 exception.  Contributions, intentional or not, to this and previous versions
 of this driver by the following are hereby acknowledged:

 Thomas Roell, Per Lindqvist, Doug Evans, Rik Faith, Arthur Tateishi,
 Alain Hebert, Ton van Rosmalen, David Chambers, William Shubert,
 ATI Technologies Incorporated, Robert Wolff, David Dawes, Mark Weaver,
 Hans Nasten, Kevin Martin, Frederic Rienthaler, Marc Bolduc, Reuben Sumner,
 Benjamin T. Yang, James Fast Kane, Randall Hopper, W. Marcus Miller,
 Henrik Harmsen, Christian Lupien, Precision Insight Incorporated,
 Mark Vojkovich, Huw D M Davies, Andrew C Aitchison, Ani Joshi,

 Linus Torvalds, William Blew, Ignacio Garcia Etxebarria, Patrick Chase,
 Vladimir Dergachev, Egbert Eich, Mike A. Harris

 ... and, many, many others from around the world.

 In addition, this work would not have been possible without the active
 support, both moral and otherwise, of the staff and management of Computing
 and Network Services at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Alberta,
 Canada.

 The driver is intended to support all ATI adapters since their VGA Wonder
 V3, including OEM counterparts.
