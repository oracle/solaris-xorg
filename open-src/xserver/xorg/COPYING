 *
 * This program is based on the Generalized Timing Formula(GTF TM)
 * Standard Version: 1.0, Revision: 1.0
 *
 * The GTF Document contains the following Copyright information:
 *
 * Copyright (c) 1994, 1995, 1996 - Video Electronics Standards
 * Association. Duplication of this document within VESA member
 * companies for review purposes is permitted. All other rights

 * While every precaution has been taken in the preparation
 * of this standard, the Video Electronics Standards Association and
 * its contributors assume no responsibility for errors or omissions,
 * and make no warranties, expressed or implied, of functionality
 * of suitability for any purpose. The sample code contained within
 * this standard may be used without restriction.
 *
 * 
 *
 * The GTF EXCEL(TM) SPREADSHEET, a sample (and the definitive)
 * implementation of the GTF Timing Standard, is available at:
 *
 * ftp://ftp.vesa.org/pub/GTF/GTF_V1R1.xls
 *
 *
 *
 * This program takes a desired resolution and vertical refresh rate,
 * and computes mode timings according to the GTF Timing Standard.
 * These mode timings can then be formatted as an XServer modeline
 * or a mode description for use by fbset(8).
 *
 *
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * The GTF allows for computation of "margins" (the visible border
 * surrounding the addressable video); on most non-overscan type
 * systems, the margin period is zero.  I've implemented the margin
 * computations but not enabled it because 1) I don't really have
 * any experience with this, and 2) neither XServer modelines nor
 * fbset fb.modes provide an obvious way for margin timings to be
 * included in their mode descriptions (needs more investigation).
 * 
 * The GTF provides for computation of interlaced mode timings;
 * I've implemented the computations but not enabled them, yet.
 * I should probably enable and test this at some point.
 *
 * 
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 * o Add support for interlaced modes.
 *
 * o Implement the other portions of the GTF: compute mode timings
 *   given either the desired pixel clock or the desired horizontal
 *   frequency.
 *
 * o It would be nice if this were more general purpose to do things
 *   outside the scope of the GTF: like generate double scan mode
 *   timings, for example.
 *   
 * o Printing digits to the right of the decimal point when the
 *   digits are 0 annoys me.
 *
 * o Error checking.

* Language:		ANSI C

* Developer:    Kendall Bennett
*
* Description:  This file includes subroutines to implement the decoding
*               and emulation of all the x86 processor instructions.
*
* There are approximately 250 subroutines in here, which correspond
* to the 256 byte-"opcodes" found on the 8086.  The table which
* dispatches this is found in the files optab.[ch].
*
* Each opcode proc has a comment preceeding it which gives it's table
* address.  Several opcodes are missing (undefined) in the table.
*
* Each proc includes information for decoding (DECODE_PRINTF and
* DECODE_PRINTF2), debugging (TRACE_REGS, SINGLE_STEP), and misc
* functions (START_OF_INSTR, END_OF_INSTR).
*
* Many of the procedures are *VERY* similar in coding.  This has
* allowed for a very large amount of code to be generated in a fairly
* short amount of time (i.e. cut, paste, and modify).  The result is
* that much of the code below could have been folded into subroutines
* for a large reduction in size of this file.  The downside would be
* that there would be a penalty in execution speed.  The file could
* also have been *MUCH* larger by inlining certain functions which
* were called.  This could have resulted even faster execution.  The
* prime directive I used to decide whether to inline the code or to
* modularize it, was basically: 1) no unnecessary subroutine calls,
* 2) no routines more than about 200 lines in size, and 3) modularize
* any code that I might not get right the first time.  The fetch_*
* subroutines fall into the latter category.  The The decode_* fall
* into the second category.  The coding of the "switch(mod){ .... }"
* in many of the subroutines below falls into the first category.
* Especially, the coding of {add,and,or,sub,...}_{byte,word}
* subroutines are an especially glaring case of the third guideline.
* Since so much of the code is cloned from other modules (compare
* opcode #00 to opcode #01), making the basic operations subroutine
* calls is especially important; otherwise mistakes in coding an
* "add" would represent a nightmare in maintenance.

* Description:  This file contains the code to implement the primitive
*				machine operations used by the emulation code in ops.c
*
* Carry Chain Calculation
*
* This represents a somewhat expensive calculation which is
* apparently required to emulate the setting of the OF and AF flag.
* The latter is not so important, but the former is.  The overflow
* flag is the XOR of the top two bits of the carry chain for an
* addition (similar for subtraction).  Since we do not want to
* simulate the addition in a bitwise manner, we try to calculate the
* carry chain given the two operands and the result.
*
* So, given the following table, which represents the addition of two
* bits, we can derive a formula for the carry chain.
*
* a   b   cin   r     cout
* 0   0   0     0     0
* 0   0   1     1     0
* 0   1   0     1     0
* 0   1   1     0     1
* 1   0   0     1     0
* 1   0   1     0     1
* 1   1   0     0     1
* 1   1   1     1     1
*
* Construction of table for cout:
*
* ab
* r  \  00   01   11  10
* |------------------
* 0  |   0    1    1   1
* 1  |   0    0    1   0
*
* By inspection, one gets:  cc = ab +  r'(a + b)
*
* That represents alot of operations, but NO CHOICE....
*
* Borrow Chain Calculation.
*
* The following table represents the subtraction of two bits, from
* which we can derive a formula for the borrow chain.
*
* a   b   bin   r     bout
* 0   0   0     0     0
* 0   0   1     1     1
* 0   1   0     1     1
* 0   1   1     0     1
* 1   0   0     1     0
* 1   0   1     0     0
* 1   1   0     0     0
* 1   1   1     1     1
*
* Construction of table for cout:
*
* ab
* r  \  00   01   11  10
* |------------------
* 0  |   0    1    0   0
* 1  |   1    1    1   0
*
* By inspection, one gets:  bc = a'b +  r(a' + b)

* Description:  Program to validate the x86 emulator library for
*               correctness. We run the emulator primitive operations
*               functions against the real x86 CPU, and compare the result
*               and flags to ensure correctness.
*
*               We use inline assembler to compile and build this program.

 FSF changes to this file are in the public domain.

 Calling this script install-sh is preferred over install.sh, to prevent
 `make' implicit rules from creating a file called install from it
 when there is no Makefile.

 This script is compatible with the BSD install script, but was written
 from scratch.  It can only install one file at a time, a restriction
 shared with many OS's install programs.

 ltmain.sh - Provide generalized library-building support services.
 NOTE: Changing this file will not affect anything until you rerun configure.
