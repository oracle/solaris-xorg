# This manifest exists solely to provide a list of directories that
# validate_pkg can match against, since the actions that define them
# are provided in other consolidations.   We don't need to deliver
# dir actions in the X packages for every directory we deliver files into.
# For those directories already defined in packages we depend on, we can
# just rely on them providing an appropriate definition and not worry about
# ensuring we specify the same owner/permissions in our packages.
#
# These can't be included in exception_lists/packaging since that causes
# all files under these directories to be flagged as errors for being
# included in packages.
